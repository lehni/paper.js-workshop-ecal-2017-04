// Functions are functional blocks of code that are given a name, just like
// with variables we learned about before. The name is followed by a pair of
// parenthesis "()", and then curly braces "{}" that open and close the block
// that contains the code.

function sayHello() {
    console.log('Hey world, still around?');
}

// Note that if we execute this script so far, nothing is printed. We need to
// actually call a function in order for its code block to be executed:

sayHello();

// If we call it multiple times, the message will also appear multiple times:

sayHello();
sayHello();
sayHello();

// Just like with variables, functions are a convenient way of referencing
// something. But instead of simple values like a number or a string, we are
// referencing a functional block of code, so we can call it by a name. It's
// like a little assistant for us who every time we call his name, he
// executes his assigned task.
