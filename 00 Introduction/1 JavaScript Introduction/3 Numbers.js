// Let's see what happens when we print a number:
console.log(10);

// As you can see, numbers appear just like strings in the console. But there
// are great things we can do with them, for example calculations:
console.log(10 * 10);

// Just like in Mathematics, we can make more complicated calculations and chain
// operators:
console.log(10 * 10 + 10);
