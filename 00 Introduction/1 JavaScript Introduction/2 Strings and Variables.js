// Now let's introduce a variable, a place to put a value, a.k.a. the bucket

// 'Hello World' is a value of the type "string", meaning a sequence of letters,
// a text. We place it in the variable with the name "myMessage", so we can call
// it later and it will give us its content. The equal sign "=" is the
// assignment operator, symbolically standing for the action of putting the
// value into the bucket:
var myMessage = "Hello again, good ol' world!";
// Note also that this time we used double-quotes (") around the string, because
// we wanted to use a single-quote in the text itself. Another option would be
// to escape the single code with a back-slash: 'Hello again, good ol\' world!'

// Now we can refer to this variable by its name and print its content.
console.log(myMessage);
